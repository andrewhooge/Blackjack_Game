## First Pass Blackjack Game

<b>Team:</b> Chet Corey and Andrew Hooge
Special Thanks to Josh and Michael for helping me navigate through some of the the challenges.

This blackjack game is designed to be simple and allow the computer (house) to play a computer generated player.  Please see business analysis in wiki for more details.

Chet and Andrew worked on game together, wireframming the game process and key functionality and then coding. It takes a bit longer on the front end but we believe will provide a better build of the game in the end.

You will notice comments in certain methods and classes.  They were added to help classmates understand our thought process.

Chet and I are submitting different code as we both worked seperately on Sunday.  We are going to work together on Monday to bring our two programs together to create the final build.  We worked through the most challenging pieces on Friday and Saturday so although the code may be different the idea was born from the same roadmap.

## What's been done:
- All classes have been mapped and general framework has been set (this was challenging...we wanted a simple solution that made it easy for others to review and update.
- Classes Card, Deck, Hand, Player and House have all had a first pass of code.

## What's to be done
- Finish game class.  Mainly the logic for determining a winner and determining the pool of chips.
- Needs tests (have for card and deck but those were provided by Clinton in previous homework)

## Needs
- Chet and Andrew to complete game with tests by end of day Monday (assuming that won't put us too far behind).
- About an Hour of Clinton's time to review code and help with testing final build
