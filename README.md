Blackjack_game
====================

This blackjack game is designed to be simple and allow the computer (house) to play a computer generated player.  Please see business analysis in wiki for more details.

<b>Notes</b>
Chet and Andrew worked on the game together initially, wireframming the game process and key functionality and then coding.  We decided on separate architecture for the final build. It takes a bit longer on the front end but we believe will provide a better build of the game in the end.

Special Thanks to Josh and Michael for helping me navigate through some of the the challenges.
